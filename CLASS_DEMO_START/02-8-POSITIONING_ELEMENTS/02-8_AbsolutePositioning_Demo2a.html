    <!--An element with position: absolute; 
    is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
    (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

    However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
    it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.-->

    <h2>This heading has an absolute position</h2>
    <p>
      With absolute positioning, an element can be placed anywhere on a page.
      The heading below is placed 100px from the left of the page and 150px from
      the top of the page.
