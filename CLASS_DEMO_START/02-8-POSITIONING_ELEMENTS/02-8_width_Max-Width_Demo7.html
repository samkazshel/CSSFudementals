    <!--a block-level element always takes up the full width available 
    (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

    Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it 
    from stretching out to the edges of its container. 
    Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. 
    The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally 
    between the two margins:-->

    <!--Note: The problem with the <div>
    above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. 
    The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

    Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. 
    This is important when making a site usable on small devices:-->


    <!--Note: The problem with the <div>
    below when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. 
    The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.-->

    <div class="ex1">This div element has width: 500px;</div>
    <br>

    <!--<div class="ex2">This div element has max-width: 500px;</div>-->

    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between
        the two divs!
