      /*The @media rule is used to define different style rules for different media types/devices.

        In CSS2 this was called media types, while in CSS3 it is called media queries.

        Media queries look at the capability of the device, and can be used to check many things, such as:

        width and height of the browser window
        width and height of the device
        orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
        resolution
        and much more*/

      /*Media Query Syntax

        @media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
           CSS-Code;
       }*/

      /*CSS3 Media Types*/
      /*all -- 	Used for all media type devices
        print -- 	Used for printers
        screen --	Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.
        speech --	Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud*/

      /*min-width	The minimum width of the display area, such as a browser window
        max-width	The maximum width of the display area, such as a browser window
        min-device-width	The minimum width of the device, such as a computer screen
        max-device-width	The maximum width of the device, such as a computer screen*/

      body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }

      @media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
        body {
          background-color: lightgreen;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Resize the browser window to see the effect!</h1>
    <p>
      The media query will only apply if the media type is screen and the
      viewport is 480px wide or wider.
